## Spirolateral Math Doodles

Read the blog post below. Lots of great information regarding spirolateral doodles. Special shoutout to Anna Weltman for creating her book [This Is Not A Maths Book](https://www.amazon.com/This-Not-Maths-Book-Activity/dp/1782402055), which is where I first learned about spirolateral math doodles.

I highly recommend having students sketch some spirolateral doodles on graph paper first. Then use Trinket and the turtle module to draw spirolateral doodles in the console. (I believe it is possible to do this in Google Colab, but I haven't created a sample with required imports.)
