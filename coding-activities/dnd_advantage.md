# DnD Advantage

This activity is based on the [The unexpected logic behind rolling multiple dice and picking the highest](https://youtu.be/X_DdGRjtwAo) by Matt Parker ([Stand-up Maths](https://www.youtube.com/@standupmaths)). Essentially, a viewer wrote in asking about a modification for Dungeons and Dragons. You can gain an advantage by rolling two dice and choose the higher value. What is the new expected value by rolling dice with this advantage?
