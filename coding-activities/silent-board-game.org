#+title: Silent Board Game

This is based on the CPM Silent Board Game in Chapter 3 of CC3. Students get an incomplete input and output table. Students attempt to fill in the table and determine an algebraic equation that describes the relationship. See the example below. 

#+CAPTION: Sample input output table
[[file:input-output-table.png][sample-table]]

In this case the algebraic rule would be $y=3x+1$. After figureing out the rule, students fired up replit, stored the inputs in a list, and created a function that has a parameter of $x$, and returns the calculation $3*x+1$. Then, using a for loop, iterated over the inputs and displayed a completed table.


* Examples


#+begin_src python :results output :exports both :tangle silent_board_game.py
import rich

game_1_inputs = [2, 11, -3, -0.5, 6, 100, -8, 5, 0]


def game_1_rule(x):
    return 5 * x + 4


magenta = "#ff33ff"
orange = "#e65c00"
dodger_blue = "#005A9C"


def display_board(inputs, rule):
    rich.print(f"[italic {dodger_blue}] x  |  y [/ italic {dodger_blue}]".center(10))
    print("-" * 11)
    for x in inputs:
        print(f"{x}".rjust(4) + " | " + f"{rule(x)}".rjust(3))
    print()


rich.print("[bold] Game 1 [/bold]")
display_board(game_1_inputs, game_1_rule)
