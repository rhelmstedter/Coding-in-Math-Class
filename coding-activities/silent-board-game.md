# Silent Board Game

This is based on the CPM Silent Board Game in Chapter 3 of CC3. Students get an incomplete input and output table. Students attempt to fill in the table and determine an algebraic equation that describes the relationship. See the example below.

In this case the algebraic rule would be ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?y=3x&plus;1). After figureing out the rule, students fired up replit, stored the inputs in a list, and created a function that has a parameter of `x`, and returns the calculation `3*x+1`. Then, using a for loop, iterated over the inputs and displayed a completed table.
