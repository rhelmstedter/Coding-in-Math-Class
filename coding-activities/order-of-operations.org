# Order of Operations

Found yet another gem from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). I recently stumbled across their python course for beginners. I decided to check it out. That's when I saw this beauty of an exercise.

~~It was so simple yet so beautiful at the same time. So I plan to put together a google collab notebook of similar problems for students to explore.~~

Google colab change the age restriction to 18+. That means none of my students can access the notebooks I have created for them. Instead i used replit. This actually works out better because I found a way to create tests in replit using `pytest`. So now students can place the parentheses whereever they want, and run it against the expected value for each function.
