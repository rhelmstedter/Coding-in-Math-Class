# Triangle and Square Numbers

I stumbled across a very nice set of puzzles from [Mathigon](https://mathigon.org/puzzles). The fourth puzzle talks about triangular and square numbers. This makes it a perfect fit with what students are doing with [visual patterns](https://www.visualpatterns.org). While the solution provided from Mathigon was heavy on the algebra, I thought this would be a great problem to solve using Python.

After posting my solution on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RHelmstedter/status/1467626314974707717), I decided to port it to Lua to get some experience in another language. I realized my initial solution was storing the triangular numbers in a list for no reason. This has some serious implications for the power of reflection on one's work.
