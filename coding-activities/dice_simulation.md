# Dice Simulation

One domain of math 7 in the CCSS is probability and statistics. We look at decks of cards, and rolling dice. Python offers a great way to run probability simulations. I am hoping that playing with simulations through code will provide context for the [law of large numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers). The script below offers a sample of how to simulate rolling two six-sided dice and then plot the frequency of each sum. The number of trials is easily adjustable.
